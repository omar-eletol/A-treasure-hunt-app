Geofencing - Starter code
========================

A treasure hunt app

Introduction
------------
A geofence is a virtual perimeter defined by GPS or RFID around a real world area. 
Geofences can be created with a radius around a point location. 

Geofencing has a lot of applications including:

- Reminder apps, such as reminding you to pick up a prescription when you get to a certain destination like your pharmacy.
- Child location services, where a parent can be notified if a child leaves an area designated by a geofence.
- Attendance, where an employer can know when their employees arrive by the time they enter a geofence.
- A treasure hunt app that uses geofences to mark the place where the treasure is hidden. When you enter that place, you will be notified that you have won! 


Pre-requisites
--------------
- The latest version of Android Studio.
- A minimum of SDK API 29 on your device or emulator. (This should still work on lower API levels but may look differenti.)
